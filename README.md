Airbender is a stack-oriented programming language and environment.

&nbsp;

### The language

It features:
- execution based on code rewriting, making most stack manipulation words (dup, swapd, popop, ...etc.) obsolete,
- simple code pattern matching,
- a special "whirl" mode that automatically fires rules when the top of data stack matches a certain pattern,
- a direct connection to every online Airbender instance, so apps can communicate through a common channel,
- events,
- several other minor goodies.

&nbsp;

### The environment

The in-browser environment is distraction free, with only:
- a basic editor, accepting drag'n drop to open files,
- an old-school terminal,
- an outliner.
